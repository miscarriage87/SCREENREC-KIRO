# Task 22: PII Masking and Privacy Controls - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive PII masking and privacy controls system for the Always-On AI Companion, providing real-time detection, configurable masking, and privacy audit capabilities.

## Completed Components

### 1. PII Detection Engine (`PIIDetector.swift`)
- **Comprehensive Pattern Recognition**: Detects 12 types of PII including emails, phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, IP addresses, MAC addresses, URLs, names, addresses, dates of birth, passports, and driver's licenses
- **Confidence Scoring**: Advanced confidence calculation with validation algorithms (Luhn check for credit cards, format validation for emails/phones)
- **Configurable Detection**: Customizable patterns, confidence thresholds, and enabled PII types
- **Context Extraction**: Captures surrounding text context for better analysis
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient regex-based detection with minimal overhead

### 2. PII Masking System (`PIIMasker.swift`)
- **Multiple Masking Strategies**: 
  - Redaction (`[REDACTED]`)
  - Asterisk replacement (`****`)
  - Partial masking (preserve first/last characters)
  - Hash replacement (consistent hashing)
  - Type-specific placeholders (`[EMAIL]`, `[PHONE]`)
  - Complete removal
- **Smart Partial Masking**: Context-aware masking for emails (preserve @ and domain), phones (preserve last 4), credit cards (preserve last 4)
- **Configurable Behavior**: Length preservation, masking ratios, custom salt for hashing
- **Masking Preview**: Preview functionality without applying changes

### 3. Real-Time PII Filtering (`PIIFilter.swift`)
- **OCR Integration**: Seamless integration with OCR processing pipeline

### 4. Privacy Audit System (`PrivacyAuditor.swift`)
- **Comprehensive Event Logging**: Tracks PII detection, masking, storage, access, deletion, and configuration changes
- **SQLite-Based Storage**: Efficient audit trail with proper indexing and querying
- **Severity Classification**: Four-level severity system (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive audit statistics and reporting
- **Automated Cleanup**: Configurable retention policies with automatic cleanup
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Critical event handling and notification system

### 5. Privacy-Aware OCR Processor (`PrivacyAwareOCRProcessor.swift`)
