- Evidence linking and outcome extraction

**Template Types:**
- **Narrative:** Human-readable stories with workflow context
- **Structured:** Organized Markdown with sections and metadata
- **Playbook:** Step-by-step action sequences for colleagues
- **Timeline:** Chronological event presentation with timestamps
- **Executive:** High-level overview with metrics and recommendations

### 4. ActivitySessionGrouper
**File:** `AlwaysOnAICompanion/Sources/Shared/Summarization/ActivitySessionGrouper.swift`

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent grouping of related events into coherent activity sessions
- Temporal and contextual similarity analysis
- Session type detection (form_filling, data_entry, navigation, research, etc.)
- Primary application detection
- Configurable grouping parameters

**Core Methods:**
- `groupEventsIntoSessions()` - Main grouping algorithm
- `performTemporalGrouping()` - Time-based grouping
- `refineGroupsByContext()` - Context-based refinement
- `determineSessionType()` - Session classification

## Data Structures

### Core Types
- `ActivityEvent` - Represents detected events for summarization
- `ActivitySession` - Coherent activity session with events and metadata
- `ActivitySummary` - Generated summary with narrative and context
- `TemporalContext` - Workflow continuity and context information
- `ActivityReport` - Comprehensive report with multiple summaries

### Enums
- `ActivityEventType` - Event types (field_change, form_submission, etc.)
- `ActivitySessionType` - Session types (data_entry, form_filling, etc.)
- `ActivityReportType` - Report types (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.)
- `TemplateType` - Template types for different output formats

- Key event extraction and outcome identification
- Multiple template generation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance testing

### 3. ActivitySessionGrouperTests
**File:** `AlwaysOnAICompanion/Tests/ActivitySessionGrouperTests.swift`

**Test Coverage:**
