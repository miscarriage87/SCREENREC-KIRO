# Task 28 Completion Summary: Terminal and Command-Line Parsing Plugin

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive terminal and command-line parsing capabilities for the Always-On AI Companion system, enhancing the existing TerminalParsingPlugin with advanced session tracking, workflow analysis, and command history monitoring.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced TerminalParsingPlugin Features
1. **Session Tracking and Management**
   - Automatic session start/end detection
   - Session state management with unique IDs
   - Working directory tracking
   - Session duration and activity monitoring

2. **Command History and Execution Tracking**
   - Real-time command execution logging
   - Command sequence analysis
   - Exit code tracking and error correlation
   - Command performance metrics

3. **Workflow Pattern Recognition**
   - Git workflow detection (status, add, commit, push sequences)
   - Build workflow identification (npm, make, cargo, etc.)
   - File management workflow analysis
   - Containerization workflow detection (Docker, Kubernetes)

4. **Enhanced Parsing Capabilities**
   - Command classification (file_listing, navigation, version_control, etc.)
   - Error message detection and categorization
   - File listing and process output parsing
   - Path detection and classification
   - Terminal prompt analysis

5. **Session Analytics**
   - Productivity scoring based on command types
   - Error rate calculation
   - Commands per minute metrics
   - Workflow pattern confidence scoring

### Key Components Added

#### Data Structures
- `TerminalSession`: Tracks session state and metadata
- `CommandExecution`: Records individual command executions
- `WorkflowPattern`: Defines workflow detection patterns
- `CommandSequence`: Tracks command patterns and frequencies
- `WorkflowAnalysis`: Session-level analytics

#### Session Management Methods
- `startSession()`: Initialize new terminal session
- `endSession()`: Finalize session and analyze workflow
- `trackCommandExecution()`: Log command execution
- `analyzeSessionWorkflow()`: Generate session insights

#### Detection Methods
- `detectSessionElements()`: Session start/end detection
- `detectWorkflowPatterns()`: Pattern recognition
- `identifyWorkflowPatterns()`: Workflow classification
- `calculateProductivityScore()`: Performance metrics

### Test Coverage
