- **Logging**: Complete uninstall audit trail

### 4. Installation Validation Tests (`Tests/InstallationValidationTests.swift`)
- **Comprehensive test suite** for installation system validation
- **System requirements testing**: macOS version, architecture, disk space
- **Build validation**: Executable and dependency verification
- **Permission testing**: Screen recording, accessibility, full disk access
- **LaunchAgent testing**: Plist generation and loading validation
- **Configuration testing**: Default settings and directory creation
- **Code signing validation**: Certificate and signature verification
- **Performance testing**: Installation speed and resource usage
- **Security testing**: File permissions and executable validation
- **Cross-version compatibility**: Multiple macOS version support

### 5. Enhanced Makefile
- **Complete build and deployment targets**:
  - `make install` - Standard installation
  - `make install-verbose` - Detailed installation output
  - `make install-dry-run` - Validation without changes
  - `make uninstall` - Complete system removal
  - `make sign` - Code signing and notarization
  - `make package` - Installer package creation
  - `make dmg` - DMG distribution creation
  - `make dist` - Complete distribution build
  - `make validate-install` - Installation requirements check
  - `make test-install` - Installation validation tests

### 6. Deployment Documentation (`DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- **Comprehensive deployment guide** covering all aspects
- **System requirements** and compatibility information
- **Build process** documentation with examples
- **Code signing setup** with certificate and notarization instructions
- **Installation system** usage and troubleshooting
- **Distribution methods** for various deployment scenarios
- **Validation and testing** procedures
- **Troubleshooting guide** for common issues
- **Security considerations** and best practices

### 7. Deployment Validation Script (`validate_deployment_system.swift`)
- **Automated validation** of entire deployment system
- **Project structure verification**: Required files and directories
- **Script validation**: Installer, code signing, and uninstall scripts
- **Build system testing**: Swift compilation and executable validation
- **Installation system verification**: Dry run testing and requirements
- **Code signing setup**: Certificate and tool availability
- **Test suite validation**: Installation test execution
- **Documentation verification**: Required documentation files
- **Makefile target validation**: All required build targets

## Key Features
